        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>As a creative marketer, I leverage data and analytics to craft compelling, high-converting narratives across platforms. Applying both an artistic flair and an analytical mindset, I optimize messaging using experimentation and measurement to boost engagement, loyalty, and sales.
            With 14 years of refining my craft as an editor and writer, I excel at creating emotionally resonant yet persuasive content. My strengths include identifying target insights through data analysis and synthesizing performance data to inform an agile, optimized content strategy.</p> 
        <p>As a current student of a postgraduate program at the McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas at Austin (completion date: January 2024), I have added Python, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Advanced Machine Learning techniques to my arsenal of analytical tools.  
            I hold a BA and an MFA degree from Dartmouth College and the University of Notre Dame, focusing on the art and science of engaging writing. As the editor/proofreader of 350+ published books, I have mastered finding resonant stories in data while conveying key messages to maximize impact. I am highly experienced in applying an audience-centric, results-driven approach to craft content that enchants yet converts.
